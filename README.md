## ðŸ‘‹ Hello, I'm Michelle!
_pronouns: she/her/hers_

I'm a student software developer looking to go into scalable software engineering post-graduation. I'm most interested in the tech for social good scene, particularly in the fields of environmental sustainability, combatting misinformation, education, and tech accessibility for people with physical and/or cognitive disabilities. 

I'm also a fiber artist looking to break into the field of e-textiles -- while my expertise currently lies in embroidery, I'm hoping to pick up sewing and weaving in the near future. I'd love to connect with other fiber artists in tech!
